# MostRecentlyInsertedQueue
Implementation of the MostRecentlyInsertedQueue


 * This program implements the queue. The purpose of this queue is to store the N most recently
 * inserted elements. The queue is bounded in size. If the queue is already full (Queue#size() == capacity),
 * the oldest element that was inserted (the head) should be evicted, and then the new element can be added at the tail.
